This repo is for review of requests for signing shim.  To create a request for review:

- clone this repo
- edit the template below
- add the shim.efi to be signed
- add build logs
- add any additional binaries/certificates/SHA256 hashes that may be needed
- commit all of that
- tag it with a tag of the form "myorg-shim-arch-YYYYMMDD"
- push that to github
- file an issue at https://github.com/rhboot/shim-review/issues with a link to your branch
- approval is ready when you have accepted tag

Note that we really only have experience with using GRUB2 on Linux, so asking
us to endorse anything else for signing is going to require some convincing on
your part.

Here's the template:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What organization or people are asking to have this signed:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uniontech Technology Co., Ltd.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What product or service is this for:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UOS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's the justification that this really does need to be signed for the whole world to be able to boot it:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UOS is yet another linux distribution based on Debian GNU/Linux. It has been actively maintained since 2019.
It is an amazing distribution, and for compatible reason, we here submit our siging request for shim.

Please create your shim binaries starting with the 15.4 shim release tar file:
https://github.com/rhboot/shim/releases/download/15.4/shim-15.4.tar.bz2

This matches https://github.com/rhboot/shim/releases/tag/15.4 and contains
the appropriate gnu-efi source.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We use git repository https://github.com/rhboot/shim/releases/tag/15.4 with gnu-efi submodule updated to the appropriate version

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
URL for a repo that contains the exact code which was built to get this binary:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We use upstream https://github.com/rhboot/shim/tree/shim-15.4

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What patches are being applied and why:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No additional patches

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If bootloader, shim loading is, GRUB2: is CVE-2020-14372, CVE-2020-25632,
 CVE-2020-25647, CVE-2020-27749, CVE-2020-27779, CVE-2021-20225, CVE-2021-20233,
 CVE-2020-10713, CVE-2020-14308, CVE-2020-14309, CVE-2020-14310, CVE-2020-14311,

 CVE-2020-15705, and if you are shipping the shim_lock module CVE-2021-3418
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, all included.

Grub is branched from 2.01

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What exact implementation of Secureboot in GRUB2 ( if this is your bootloader ) you have ?
* Upstream GRUB2 shim_lock verifier or * Downstream RHEL/Fedora/Debian/Canonical like implementation ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We use upstream grub2 lockdown + shim_lock verifier.

We also pull patches from Debian for the linux loader, but the verification code of those patches will only get used if secureboot is active but lockdown is not. (To our knowledge this should never happen.)

We disable most loaders as it is done in the Debian downstream code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If bootloader, shim loading is, GRUB2, and previous shims were trusting affected
by CVE-2020-14372, CVE-2020-25632, CVE-2020-25647, CVE-2020-27749,
  CVE-2020-27779, CVE-2021-20225, CVE-2021-20233, CVE-2020-10713,
  CVE-2020-14308, CVE-2020-14309, CVE-2020-14310, CVE-2020-14311, CVE-2020-15705,
  and if you were shipping the shim_lock module CVE-2021-3418
  ( July 2020 grub2 CVE list + March 2021 grub2 CVE list )
  grub2:

* were old shims hashes provided to Microsoft for verification
  and to be added to future DBX update ?
* Does your new chain of trust disallow booting old, affected by CVE-2020-14372,
  CVE-2020-25632, CVE-2020-25647, CVE-2020-27749,
  CVE-2020-27779, CVE-2021-20225, CVE-2021-20233, CVE-2020-10713,
  CVE-2020-14308, CVE-2020-14309, CVE-2020-14310, CVE-2020-14311, CVE-2020-15705,
  and if you were shipping the shim_lock module CVE-2021-3418
  ( July 2020 grub2 CVE list + March 2021 grub2 CVE list )
  grub2 builds ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
were old shims hashes provided to Microsoft for verification and to be added to future DBX update:
Hashes for SHIMs signed before July 2020 provided through keybase No SHIM signed Between July 2020 and February 2021

Shim 15.3 has not been distributed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If your boot chain of trust includes linux kernel, is
"efi: Restrict efivar_ssdt_load when the kernel is locked down"
upstream commit 1957a85b0032a81e6482ca4aab883643b8dae06e applied ?
Is "ACPI: configfs: Disallow loading ACPI tables when locked down"

upstream commit 75b0cea7bf307f362057cc778efe89af4c615354 applied ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, we currently use linux lts kernel 5.4:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you use vendor_db functionality of providing multiple certificates and/or
hashes please briefly describe your certificate setup. If there are allow-listed hashes
please provide exact binaries for which hashes are created via file sharing service,

available in public with anonymous access for verification
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[your text here]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are re-using a previously used (CA) certificate, you will need
to add the hashes of the previous GRUB2 binaries to vendor_dbx in shim
in order to prevent GRUB2 from being able to chainload those older GRUB2
binaries. If you are changing to a new (CA) certificate, this does not

apply. Please describe your strategy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This problem does not occur, we are submitting for the first time

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What OS and toolchain must we use to reproduce this build?  Include where to find it, etc.  We're going to try to reproduce your build as close as possible to verify that it's really a build of the source tree you tell us it is, so these need to be fairly thorough. At the very least include the specific versions of gcc, binutils, and gnu-efi which were used, and where to find those binaries.
If the shim binaries can't be reproduced using the provided Dockerfile, please explain why that's the case and the differences would be.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We use Debian Bullseye on x86_64 as build environment for shim.

You can use the Dockerfile to verify the build.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which files in this repo are the logs for your build?   This should include logs for creating the buildroots, applying patches, doing the build, creating the archives, etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The file 'logs.txt' holds the complete build run

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add any additional information you think we may need to validate this shim
